This repo is for ideas to apply AI and automation to optimize the Operation of a big telecom company (call it Telcom M).

## Context: My company (company E) is consulting for Telcom M to apply AI in their operation. We want to show them cases, so we will be the one who develope the solution for them.

## Your task:
Write for me 1 use case of AI automation in operation.
- Write in details, what is the current problem? 
Example: The duration since the time customer A call telcom M to the time of implementation is too long. Customer does not want to wait, they want it only 2 hours from the call, they will have internet ready.
- What is the workflow or userflow (draw a flowchart), step by step
- Where in that flow that AI can come in to automate the process?
- At each step, if apply AI, what is the gain for Customers and Telcom M? Materialize and quantify that gain.

## Technical:
- Development tools?  (such as n8n, python pure code, langchain, microsoft power automate,...)
- Test cases
- other as well. I am not a technical, developer.
