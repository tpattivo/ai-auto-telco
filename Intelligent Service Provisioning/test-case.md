### Performance Testing Framework:

**Load Testing**
```python
# Example load testing script
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import time

async def test_ai_endpoint(session, customer_data):
    start_time = time.time()
    async with session.post('/api/process-order', json=customer_data) as response:
        result = await response.json()
        end_time = time.time()
        return {
            'response_time': end_time - start_time,
            'status': response.status,
            'result': result
        }

async def load_test():
    # Test with 1000 concurrent requests
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [test_ai_endpoint(session, generate_test_data()) 
                for _ in range(1000)]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    # Analyze results
    avg_response_time = sum(r['response_time'] for r in results) / len(results)
    success_rate = sum(1 for r in results if r['status'] == 200) / len(results)
    
    print(f"Average Response Time: {avg_response_time:.2f}s")
    print(f"Success Rate: {success_rate:.2%}")
