## üìã Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive AI automation use case designed to transform Telcom M's service provisioning process from a 3-7 day manual operation into a 2-4 hour automated system.

### üéØ Problem Statement

Currently, when customers call Telcom M to request new internet service (fiber/broadband), the process takes 3-7 days from initial call to service activation. This lengthy timeline involves multiple manual steps, human coordination, and results in:

- **Customer Frustration**: 68% of customers expect same-day or next-day service activation
- **Revenue Loss**: Each day of delay costs Telcom M approximately $45 per customer in potential revenue
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Field technicians make multiple unnecessary trips due to poor planning
- **Resource Waste**: Manual scheduling leads to 30% technician idle time
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Competitors offering faster activation are winning customers

### üöÄ AI Solution Impact

- **Time Reduction**: 85-95% faster service delivery (3-7 days ‚Üí 2-4 hours)
- **Customer Experience**: 90% reduction in customer effort, 99% appointment reliability
- **Financial Impact**: $20.5M annual benefit ($12.5M revenue + $8M cost savings)
- **ROI**: 450% return on investment with 3.2-month payback period
