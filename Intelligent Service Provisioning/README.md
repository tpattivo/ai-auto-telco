# AI Automation Use Case: Intelligent Service Provisioning and Network Optimization

## Current Problem: Slow and Manual Service Activation Process

**The Challenge:**
Currently, when a customer calls Telcom M to request new internet service (fiber/broadband), the process takes 3-7 days from initial call to service activation. This lengthy timeline involves multiple manual steps, human coordination, and often results in:

- **Customer Frustration**: 68% of customers expect same-day or next-day service activation
- **Revenue Loss**: Each day of delay costs Telcom M approximately $45 per customer in potential revenue
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Field technicians make multiple unnecessary trips due to poor planning
- **Resource Waste**: Manual scheduling leads to 30% technician idle time
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Competitors offering faster activation are winning customers

**Specific Pain Points:**
1. **Manual Service Feasibility Check**: Takes 4-6 hours to verify network capacity and infrastructure availability
2. **Inefficient Scheduling**: Technician dispatch relies on basic calendar systems without optimization
3. **Poor Resource Allocation**: No predictive analysis of equipment needs or network capacity
4. **Reactive Maintenance**: Issues discovered only during installation, causing delays
5. **Limited Customer Communication**: Customers receive minimal updates during the process
